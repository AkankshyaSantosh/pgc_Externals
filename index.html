        <p>
          Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.

The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads.

        <h2>Vaccination</h2>
        <p>Now that the Covid vaccines are avalible all over the world for almost all age groups over 18, <br>it's time to take it, but how do we know which one? <br><br>let's see which vaccines are reliable</p>
      <br><br>
        <p><b>Covaxin vs Covishield: Are there differences?</b></p>
        <br>
        <p>Both Covaxin and Covishield (Oxford-AstraZeneca make) are homegrown, traditional vaccines developed using mechanisms that have been depended on for long. Hence, they may be termed relatively safer than other modern vaccines, and carry a lower than usual risk of side-effects. Clinical studies have also proved that Indian vaccines have good efficacy rates right now.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The two vaccines work to build up the antibody count in the body, which will alert the body to unleash protective defences whenever a future attack is suspected. Thus, any vaccine hesitancy rates and misinformation about the same need to be done away with.</p>

  <p><b>Side-effects of Covaxin</b></p>  
  <br>
  <p>Covaxin, which has been developed by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech uses an inactive version of the virus. According to the factsheet specified by the company, mild, reactogenic side-effects can be expected post-injection. Some of the side-effects which have been noticed till right now include redness in the arm, pain at the injection site, low-grade temperature, malaise, headache, vomiting, weakness and fatigue.</p>

  <p><b>Side-effects of Covishield</b></p>  
<p>The Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine, marketed in India as Covishield was one of the first competitors in the race and largely considered a safe vaccine to use. However, recent reports from France, regarding certain side-effects made many consider it a tad bit unsafe for use, especially amongst the senior groups.
  Nonetheless, the factsheet maintains that a person can develop some symptoms, on the milder side such as pain, warmth, itching, bruising, fatigue, chills, fever, nausea, muscle ache, lumps and malaise. Severe side-effects such as extremely high temperature (over 102 degrees Farhenheit), coughing, breathing difficulties, nervous problems, anaphylaxis are possible, though rare. It should be noted that the severe reactions, observed during the clinical studies were ruled out to be unrelated to the vaccine.</p>
